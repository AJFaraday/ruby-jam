Panellist Cheat Sheet
=====================

Golden Rule!
------------

Relax, take it easy and have fun.

It's a little competitive, but ultimately we're all pulling together to make an
enjoyable, entertaining and informative show. Winning isn't everything.

Manners
-------

Some general manners guidelines for panel games, and specifically Just A Minute

* Not a word until round one. The introduction primes the audience for the show, this is easiest to do with one voice.
* Good humour is the most important ingredient.
* Avoid speaking over each other, listening to two voices is hard work.
* When the timer is running, one speaker is being featured. Listen closely.
* There is often some argument following challenges.
  * This is part of the game but KEEP IT FRIENDLY!
  * The hosts word goes. This isn't just megalomania, it helps to keep the game moving.
* If you are harsh in your challenges, or unkind in your arguments, you may find harsh challenges against you are more likely to be accepted.
* Be clear about your challenges, buzz, and declare your challenge (if your buzzer has lit up). For example,
  * *buzz* hesitation
  * *buzz* repetition of [word]
  * *buzz* deviation (followed by why you think they have deviated)

Principal Rules
---------------

Here's the three main rules of Just A Minute, and a few guidelines on when you
can and can't challenge.

Hesitation:

* Any lengthy pause
* Any hedging sound (erm, um, ahhh etc.)
* Slowing down until they're almost stopped.
* But! Let people take a breath after sentences.

Repetition:

* Repeating any word that they have said during that round.
* If they are challenged, then regain the subject, they can not repeat words from their first session.
* Panellists are allowed to repeat words that are in the topic.
* Be lenient about join words (I, and, to etc.), let one repetition go, but challenge on the third use.
* In TechJAM, they are allowed to repeat common short forms (e.g. if the topic is Hypertext Markup Language, you may repeat HTML).

Deviation:

* Leaving the subject, changing to another topic. (There's some wiggle-room here, based on entertainement value and the hosts judgement).
* Saying something patently untrue about the topic (there will be a judgement call about this type of challenge).

Tactics
-------

* Speaking in a slow, measured way is beneficial. Just don't slow down to a stop.
* It ~can~ be legitimate to leave the topic if you re-define it early on (e.g. "I've got a dog called Single Responsibility Principal..."), but if you go too far this is likely to be challenged.
* If you don't know about a topic, you could try talking about the fact that you know nothing about it, or about knowing it very well (instead of actually talking about it). This probably won't last the minute, but it's fairly entertaining and better than simply stopping.
* Using lists is a common strategy.
  * This can be risky, you risk repeating yourself, or repeating the word 'and' too many times.
  * Lists of synonyms can be used in most sentences. E.g. "I learned everything I know about this topic from my mentor, adviser, teacher, confidant, role model... "
  * Most topics could lead to a list. E.g. with the topic of "How I like to work" you could say "I like to work remotely whilst travelling between various cities such as London, Paris, Milan..."
