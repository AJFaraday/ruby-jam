Panellist Cheat Sheet

Manners

Some general manners guidelines for panel games, and specifically Just A Minute

* Not a word until round one. The introduction primes the audience for the show, this is easiest to do with one voice.
* Avoid speaking over each other, listening to two voices is hard work.
* When the timer is running, one speaker is being featured, listen closely.
* There is often some argument following challenges.
  * This is part of the game but KEEP IT FRIENDLY!
  * The hosts word goes. This isn't just megalomania, it helps to keep the game moving.
* If you are harsh in your challenges, or unkind in your arguments, you may find harsh challenges in return are more likely to be accepted.  

Principal Rules
---------------

Here's the three main rules of Just A Minute, and a few guidelines on when you
can and can't challenge.

Hesitation:

* Any lengthy pause
* Any hedging sound (erm, um, ahhh etc.)
* Slowing down until they're almost stopped
* Let people take a breath after sentences.

Repetition:

* Repeating any word that panellist has said during that round.
* If they are challenged, then regain the subject, they can not repeat words from their first session.
* Panellists are allowed to repeat words that are in the topic.
* Be lenient about join words (I, and, to etc.), let one repetition go, but challenge on three.
* In TechJAM, they are allowed to repeat common short forms (e.g. if the topic is Hypertext Markup Language, you may repeat HTML).

Deviation:

* Leaving the subject, changing to another topic.
* Saying something patently untrue about the topic (there will be a judgement call about this type of challenge).
